  	<p>The ArakhnÃª.org Network Editor (NetEditor) is a free Java component that
  	   permits to edit and show connected-graphs. NetEditor is only composed by
  	   a drawing area in which you can draw nodes and edges.</p>
  	<p>This version of NetEditor is an original idea of Mahdi HANNOUN and St&eacute;phane GALLAND.
  	   In 2001, we decide to develop a new graph-editing library because existing ones
  	   don't support our needs, or are to difficult to extend.</p>
